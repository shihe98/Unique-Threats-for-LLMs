# The Life Cycle of LLM

## Pre-training LLMs
Model developers collect a large corpus as a pre-training dataset, including books, web pages, conversational texts, and code. They then use large-scale, Transformer-based networks and advanced training algorithms, enabling the models to learn rich language knowledge from vast amounts of unlabeled texts. After obtaining the pre-trained LLM, developers upload it to open-source community platforms to gain profits. We consider three malicious entities: contributors, developers, and users.
